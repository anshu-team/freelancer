                                            <p>I made a game once.</p>
                                            <p>I designed it, programmed it and then tested it, fixed it, tested
                                                more,
                                                fixed, tested, fixed ‚Ä¶ e.t.c</p>
                                            <p>I then unleashed it into the world, waiting for the money to flow
                                                in ‚Äì
                                                what I got was a rude awakening.&nbsp; The game had some bugs in
                                                it that
                                                were cringe worthy to say the least ‚Äì and the public negative
                                                feedback
                                                destroyed my sales.</p>
                                            <p>The big problem with publicly releasing a game is that those who
                                                play it
                                                don&#8217;t send in bug reports ‚Äì no, they let rip anonymously
                                                on public
                                                forum boards; the stupid part of this is that you need to
                                                actively
                                                search for it.</p>
                                            <p>The most negative post I have ever read on one of my games I
                                                found by
                                                accident ‚Äì 4 hours before a major exam; I don&#8217;t care what
                                                anyone
                                                says, it does affect you and it did affect my mark on that
                                                exam.&nbsp;
                                                The negative post pointed out some major bugs and I fixed those
                                                bugs
                                                real quick, the problem was that the post was nasty ‚Äì and 3
                                                months
                                                old!&nbsp; I really wish that they had sent me something so I
                                                could have
                                                fixed them all earlier üôÅ</p>
                                            <p>It was a sports game and some of the bugs that got through all my
                                                testing
                                                were-</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>If a player was sent off when they had the ball then they
                                                    took the
                                                    ball of the ground with them; the game had to wait until
                                                    that player
                                                    came back on!</li>
                                                <li>You could not take the ball out of play (naturally) but you
                                                    could
                                                    hit an opposition player that hard that you knocked them
                                                    into the
                                                    crowd (out of play) ‚Äì you could then PASS the ball to a
                                                    player in
                                                    the crowd, they would then run to the touchdown zone and
                                                    walk onto
                                                    the legal area and score.</li>
                                                <li>If you kicked the ball along the ground to nobody the AI
                                                    didn&#8217;t know where the ball was, and simply stopped
                                                    where they
                                                    were.</li>
                                                <li>At the end of the season AI teams were selling all their
                                                    players for
                                                    the money; and then promptly buying them back at market
                                                    rates when
                                                    they realised that they had no players!</li>
                                                <li>During player auctions if you hit the F10 key then all
                                                    bidding
                                                    stopped and you got your player.&nbsp; Star players could be
                                                    bought
                                                    for 10% of their price if you timed it right.</li>
                                                <li>&nbsp;</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>There were a lot more but that should give you an idea that these
                                                bugs
                                                were not found by me because I didn&#8217;t play the game this
                                                way.&nbsp; If I had the ball I tried to dodge my opponent, I
                                                didn&#8217;t try to punch them and get sent off and I certainly
                                                never
                                                kicked the ball along the ground to nobody!</p>
                                            <p>The problems with these bugs is that I never encountered them
                                                because I
                                                played the game I had designed it to be played ‚Äì but players
                                                will play
                                                the game the way they wish to play it.</p>
